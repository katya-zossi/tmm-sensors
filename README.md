# tmm-sensors
The examples in this repostitory demonstrate how the Lorentz reciprocity theorem can be used 
to study polarizable particles at the surface of multilayer complex materials. 
The file 'reciprocity.py' includes easy-to-use functions to experiment with 
reciprocity theorem and 'tutorials.ipynb' includes interactive examples for a
multilayer stack in the Kretschmann configuration. 

The scripts have been tested in an environment with the following packages:
* tmm 0.1.8
* python 3.7.9
* numpy 1.19.2 
* scipy 1.5.2
* matplotlib 3.3.4

Work in progress to make tmm-sensors into a PyPI package.
